Read me.

This program should be quite self-explanatory and it will also help guide you.
Start by picking a time range from 1 – 30 days, then choose a budget amount (you can change this later)

If you type “helpme” when it asks you what you want to do, it will give you a command list:
here is a list of commands.
'withdraw', this command allows you to list an expense and withdraw money from your budget
'showlog', this command shows the editing history of the budget.
'deposit', this command allows you to add to the budget.
'status', this command shows you the current budget

You can deposit money to the budget using the “deposit” command (you can cancel the process if you enter “0”):  Type the amount you want to add, and then it will ask for a reason why, for example:” found 30$ in the couch”. Then if it is accepted it will return to the main input and you can type your next command.

The “withdraw” function is similar to the deposit function except it asks you what you want to withdraw instead of deposit, if you deplete your budget it will warn you that your budget has been depleted.

The “status” function just displays the current time left and total budget left.

Finally the “showlog” function will show the withdraw and deposit history throughout the budget. each part will include the amount changed, the reason, and the date it happened.
